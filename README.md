## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)

## Setup

After cloning the repo, setup the app by following these steps.

- Install the required Node version

  ```sh
  nodenv install
  ```

- Install dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Create a `.env` file for local development

  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Start any required Docker services, such as Postgres:

  ```sh
  npm run docker
  ```

  > **Note:** Ensure that Docker has finished and your containers are running before proceeding.

- Setup the database:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Run the build, which generates the App's Node server:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

## Development

- Start the app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file change:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

- Once running, visit:

  ```
  https://localhost:3000
  ```

- By default there is a new user with some data you can use to get started:
  - Email: jane@example.com
  - Password: password

- Manage the database with the Prisma CLI. See [Developing with Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/developing-with-prisma-migrate).

  Some common operations are:

  | Goal | Command(s) |
  | ---- | ---------- |
  | Apply pending migrations | `npx prisma migrate dev` |
  | Add a new model | Modify prisma/schema.prisma and run `npx prisma migrate dev` to generate a migration |
  | Explore the db | `npx prisma studio` |
  | Reset your db | `npx prisma migrate reset` |

- Debug server side code by placing a `debugger` in your code, open up Chrome, and go to `chrome://inspect`.

## Troubleshooting

Something's gone awry ü§®? Try these steps:

- Re-build the Remix server

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

- Re-install all dependencies (a "clean install")

  ```sh
  npm ci
  ```
